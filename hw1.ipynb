In different object manipulation scenario, the system is described by difference $D$ and $F$. For example, when the robot is rotating a door knob, one or more joints can be contrained by the door knob. An other hand, if the gripper is holding an arbitrary object, joints will not be as contrained as the first example, but the weight of the object will still effect verticle oriented joints. Therefore, servoing this system is hybrid when the gripper different manipulation tasks.\n",
