    "I will try to model human robot interaction process with hybrid system and perform motion planning and control to the system. I am hoping create this hybrid model such that it is generalizable to any (most of) the human robot interaction motions. However, for the motion planning and control, I will specifically focus on HRI scenario - object hand-off between human and robot. The reason I choose the hand-off scenario is that relative research fields have been well explored in the pass, such that there are existing evaluation functions that can be used to guide the continuous motion in difference discrete states of a hand-off process. I am hoping to improve the whole hand-off experience by optimizing difference cost functions in difference discrete states using hybrid system.\n"
